Detailed Description
In contrast to the SimulationConfig, which has only static configuration data, the RuntimeConfig holds information that can be different from game to game.

By default is defines for example what map to load and the random start seed. It is assembled from scratch each time starting a game.

Developers can add custom data to quantum_code/quantum.state/RuntimeConfig.User.cs (don't forget to fill out the serialization methods).

Like the DeterministicSessionConfig this config is distributed to every other client after the first player connected and joined the Quantum plugin.
