The Quantum navigation system provides a deterministic Navigation Mesh and a set of Navigation Agent components to navigate and steer entities through the game world.

N.B.: Core.NavigationSystem() needs to be enabled in SystemSetup.cs for the navigation related functionalities to work.

More information on the API is available in the documentation included in the SDK docs\PhotonQuantum-Documentation.chm.
