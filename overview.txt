Introduction
The Quantum physics engine is cross-platform, deterministic and fully supports Quantum's predict rollback model.

This page covers both 2D, 3D and 2.5D Physics documentation.

Important: the 2D and 3D APIs are very similar. This will become apparent in the examples we will cover; each example will be presenting the 2D code followed by its 3D equivalent.
