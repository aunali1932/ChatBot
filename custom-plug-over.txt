Overview
You can get Quantum Custom Server Plugin SDK from our quantum sdk page.

It contains Quantum server libraries, the Photon-Server and a sample project to enable you to run your own Photon-Server Quantum plugin.

Common features:

Run your game simulation on the server
Send server snapshots to late-joining or reconnecting clients
Forward the input or replays to another backend
Safely retrieve player configurations/load-outs/inventories from another backend
Forward game results to another backend
Add additional user authentication
Start by watching the intro video below.

The set up tutorial demonstrates how the sample project runs on a local Photon-Server.

Use the API docs to gather more information about the features you want to implement.
